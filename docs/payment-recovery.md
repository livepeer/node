# Payment state and transaction recovery

The orchestrator database contains winning ticket signatures and the recipient
randomness needed to redeem those winners. Keep it owner-only and backed up.
Payment parameters, authentication keys, session balances, and ticket nonce
replay guards are not persisted. Restarting rotates the keys and requires new
paid sessions; stored winning tickets remain redeemable.

Clients carry the signer's signed payment state, which is a bearer credential
while authorization is cached. When Kafka is enabled, each signer also owns a
durable accounting-event outbox. Back up that outbox and the clearinghouse's
accounting state independently. Start fresh client sessions after restoring
recipient state or migrating from legacy signed state.

See [orchestrator setup](orchestrator.md#enable-payments) and
[signer setup](signer.md#kafka-accounting-and-budgets) for configuration.

## Signer accounting recovery

Keep `Kafka.OutboxDB` on persistent local storage, with one file per signer replica.
Create its parent directory before startup. New files are created with mode 0600;
existing files must be owner-only regular files. SQLite uses WAL and FULL synchronous
commits. Back up with SQLite's backup API or stop the signer before copying the database
and any WAL/SHM files. Monitor both pending payload bytes and actual disk usage.

Use a dedicated owner-only directory (mode 0700) and preserve owner-only
permissions on the database, `-wal`, and `-shm` files during backup and restore.
Startup rejects nonregular or permissive database and sidecar files. The WAL
can contain accounting payloads.

Restart with the same signer key, Kafka broker, topic and outbox path. Pending events
resume automatically with their original IDs and exact payloads. A nonempty outbox
rejects a changed signer address, broker or topic. Drain it before changing those
settings; credential rotation does not change its destination binding. Broker
addresses learned from Kafka metadata can change without changing the bootstrap
configuration. Never delete pending rows or replace the outbox to clear an outage.

Only acknowledged events are removed. A crash after Kafka accepts a batch but before
local deletion causes replay; the consumer must deduplicate event IDs. A partial or
uncertain write retains the entire batch. The outbox is a delivery queue, not an audit
archive: acknowledged payloads are deleted. Restoring a backup can replay old events
and omit events created after that backup, so preserve the latest outbox during rollback.

Kafka outages allow signing to continue until the outbox runs out of capacity. Failed
local persistence returns 503 without payment credentials. Events are saved before the
HTTP response; connection loss after saving an event does not retract its charge.
Separate client retries emit separate events. Payment state can still move between
replicas with the same key and webhook configuration; outbox files must not be shared.

## Orchestrator transaction recovery

The orchestrator account is the redeemer. Redemption attempts use these states:

| State | Meaning and recovery |
| --- | --- |
| Queued (no attempt) | Wait for parameter expiry. Preparation failures leave the ticket eligible for another attempt. |
| `prepared` | Signed bytes, nonce and locally computed hash are durable; the worker resumes the first send after restart. |
| `broadcast` | A send may have reached RPC. Reconcile receipts automatically; an operator may explicitly resend identical bytes. |
| `submitted` | RPC acknowledged the hash. Keep checking receipts; explicit identical-byte retry is available if necessary. |
| `confirmed` | Receipt is successful, at or below the finalized head, and matches the canonical block hash. Liability is settled. |
| `reverted` | A canonical finalized receipt failed. Retain the audit row; do not resubmit automatically. |
| `expired` | Ticket creation round is outside the contract validity window. Retain the audit row. |

An uncertain broadcast blocks preparation of a new transaction
for this worker, preventing accidental nonce reuse. The redemption key must be
exclusive to this worker; do not submit concurrent CLI transactions from it.
Only a canonical finalized receipt marks a ticket redeemed. A pending receipt,
reorg, unavailable finalized head or RPC failure retains uncertainty and liability.

Inspect status without a key or RPC connection:

```sh
livepeer orchestrator redemptions --redeemer-db /var/lib/livepeer/orchestrator-redeemer.sqlite
```

After checking the hash on the configured chain, explicitly retry the stored
transaction if it is absent or needs rebroadcast:

```sh
livepeer orchestrator redemptions \
  --redeemer-db /var/lib/livepeer/orchestrator-redeemer.sqlite \
  --retry-transaction 0xTRANSACTION_HASH --submit \
  --rpc-url-file /run/secrets/livepeer-payment-rpc-url \
  --chain-id 42161
```

Operator-configured RPC endpoints use normal system TLS trust. This operation
uses the exact saved signed bytes, nonce and hash; it cannot create a replacement
or change fees. A retry error retains the hash and uncertain state. No key file
is needed.

In-memory control state is bounded: payment sessions have a 100,000-entry quota
and 24-hour inactivity retention; ticket replay guards have a 1,000,000-nonce
quota and are pruned at payment parameter expiry. Active session accounting keeps
session activity current. Expiry is monotonic within a recipient lifetime so
a backward chain observation cannot revive parameters after their replay guards
are removed. Auth-token refresh never resets nonce tracking. Winning tickets
and uncertain transactions are retained for audit/reconciliation, so back up
and monitor database disk use independently of these control-state quotas.

Redemption planning uses geth's dynamic-fee selection and requires a base fee
in the RPC header; a missing base fee leaves the ticket queued with an error.
`RedeemerMaxFeePerGas` optionally caps the fee in wei per gas; a plan above
that ceiling remains queued without signing or broadcasting. Prepared and
submitted identities reserve their nonces, including after restart. Keep the
redemption key exclusive to this database/worker; local nonce tracking does not
coordinate another process using the same key. Explicit retry always resends
the stored transaction without changing its fees.
