# Livepeer Node

Livepeer Node contains services and command-line tools for the Livepeer network.
It includes an orchestrator for Livepeer runners, a remote signer for network
payments and orchestrator discovery, and a protocol CLI for managing staking,
earnings, funding and governance on-chain.

| Executable | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `livepeer` | Runs the bundled component commands. |
| `livepeer-orchestrator` | Registers runners, reserves sessions, proxies traffic, and redeems payment tickets. |
| `livepeer-signer` | Signs identities and payments, discovers orchestrators, and optionally publishes accounting events. |
| `livepeer-chain` | Inspects accounts and contracts and manages staking, earnings, funds, and governance. |

The orchestrator supports persistent and single-shot sessions, HTTP streaming,
server-sent events (SSE), WebSockets, and Trickle channels. It can run locally
without payments or use Ethereum payment tickets. The signer requires chain
configuration.

## Build

Install Go 1.27.1 or newer, then run from the repository root:

```sh
make build
bin/livepeer version
bin/livepeer orchestrator --help
```

## Run a local example

This example forwards a request to a small HTTP service through a static runner.
It runs off-chain and does not require Ethereum, payments or secrets.

In one terminal, start the example runner:

```bash
while true; do
  printf 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 24\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\nhello from local runner\n' | \
  nc -l 127.0.0.1 9000 >/dev/null || break
done
```

In a second terminal, from the repository root, start the orchestrator:

```sh
bin/livepeer orchestrator --config configs/orchestrator/local.example.toml
```

The [local configuration](configs/orchestrator/local.example.toml) loads a
[single-shot runner](configs/orchestrator/runners.local.example.toml) and grants
its loopback destination separately for application traffic and health checks.

In a third terminal, check readiness, discovery, and forwarding. Allow up to
five seconds for the first runner health check before checking discovery:

```sh
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8936/readyz
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8935/discovery
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8935/apps/local-runner/app/hello
```

Expect `ready`, a discovery entry for `local-runner`, and
`hello from local runner`. Readiness uses the separate metrics port. Stop the
runner and orchestrator with Ctrl-C in their terminals.

## Configure a deployment

Use [configuration and secrets](docs/configuration.md) for credentials, raw
Ethereum key files, and probe addresses. Then follow the component guides:

- [Orchestrator](docs/orchestrator.md): dynamic/static runners, networking, TLS,
  proxy URLs, limits, and payments.
- [Signer](docs/signer.md): chain access, price limits, authorization, and Kafka
  accounting.
- [Chain commands](docs/chain.md): previewing and submitting transactions.
- [Payment recovery](docs/payment-recovery.md): backups, restart, and uncertain
  transaction recovery.
- [Staging and cutover](docs/cutover.md): checks against your chain and contracts
  before moving production traffic.

Chain state changes simulate and estimate gas first. They require `--submit`
to broadcast; `--wait` waits for successful inclusion. Trickle retains five
segments per channel, with a 10 MB limit per segment and no global byte cap.

For tests, SDK fixtures, and packaging, see [development](docs/development.md).
The [documentation index](docs/README.md) links architecture and protocol
references as well as historical records.
